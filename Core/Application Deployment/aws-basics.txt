- Provides block storage for use with EC2 instances.
- Use Case: A database application uses EBS for fast and reliable storage.

- This provides block storage or block volume for ec2 instance. read and write becomes fast if we attach ec2 and ebs.compute


3. Database
a. aurora
b. dynamoDB
c. RDS



4. network and content delivery
